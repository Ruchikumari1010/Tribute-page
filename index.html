               Maharishi  <br><br>  
                ☛ Valmiki Sanskrit: वाल्मीकि, Vālmīki was a legendary poet
                who is celebrated as the traditional author of the
                 epic Ramayana, based on the attribution in the text itself.He is revered as Ādi Kavi, the first
                  poet, author of Ramayana, the first epic poem.<br><br> 
                ☛The Ramayana, originally written by Valmiki, consists of 24,000 shlokas
                and seven cantos (kaṇḍas). The Ramayana is composed of about 480,002 words, being a quarter of
                 the length of the full text of the Mahabharata or about four times
                  the length of the Iliad <br><br>  
                ☛   The Ramayana tells the story of a prince, Rama of
                the city of Ayodhya in the Kingdom of Kosala, whose wife Sita is abducted by Ravana,
                 the demon-king (Rakshasa) of Lanka.
                <br><br> ☛   The scholars'
                estimates for the earliest stage of the text
                 ranging from the 8th to 4th centuries BCE,and later stages
                  extending up to the 3rd century CE, although original date of composition is unknown.
                <br><br> ☛   As with many traditional epics, it has gone through a process of
                interpolations and redactions, making it impossible to date accurately.
                <br><br> ☛  British satirist Aubrey Menen says that Valmiki was "recognized as<br>
                a literary genius," and thus was considered, "an outlaw," presumably<br>
                 because of his "philosophic scepticism," as part of an "Indian Enlightenment"<br>
                  period.
                <br><br> ☛  Valmiki is also quoted as being the contemporary of Rama.
                <br><br> ☛  Menen
                claims Valmiki is "the first author in all history to bring himself into his own composition."
                <br><br> ☛  "मा निषाद प्रतिष्ठां त्वमगमः शाश्वतीः समाः।
                यत्क्रौञ्चमिथुनादेकमवधीः काममोहितम्॥'
                <br><br> ☛  You will find no rest for the long years of Eternity
                For you killed a bird in love and unsuspecting.
